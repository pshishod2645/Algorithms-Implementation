# Algorithms-Implementation

It often happens that we properly understand the logic behind an algorithm and it's pseudo code, But we have a hard time implementing the algorithm on our own. And even if we finally manages come up with an implementaion it often contains hidden bugs or the implementation is too naive and has a  scope for improvement. Though editorials and tutorials are available with pseudo code, but the actual implementaions are difficult to find for many of the advanced algorithms.

This repository is created to provide implementations to the most common used algorithms and data structures used in competitive programming. 

Since there must be a way to check if the implementaion is bug free or not, I am restricting myself from directly posting the implementation, instead I will be adding the implementation of algorithm in form of solution to a basic problem(which uses that algorithm ) from one of the online judges.
